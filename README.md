This is a haskell project that contains the main computations for a proof that the longest arithmetic progression that is a subset of a geometric progression $(\xi^i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}, \xi \in \mathbb{C}$ is only $3$, unless $|\xi| = 1$.

A more detailed proof and explanation will be uploaded sometime around Christmas, when I have some time to make it pretty.
